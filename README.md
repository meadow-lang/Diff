# diff

Find the differences between two sequences or texts, for
[Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-lang/meadow). It offers Myers, patience and
LCS diffs, unified diffs like `diff -u` and `git diff` print, and inline
(word-level) changes.

This package is a port of Rust's [`similar`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/similar)
2.7.0 with its `text`, `inline` and `unicode` features. It finds the same
operations, groups them into the same hunks and prints the same text.

## AI disclosure

Diff is written with AI coding agents: Anthropic's Claude, through Claude Code.
Most of the code, the tests, the documentation and the commit messages in this
repository were written by an agent, under the direction of the project's
author, who decides the design and what goes in. Read it, and rely on it, with
that in mind.

## Install

```sh
meadow add meadow-lang/Diff
```

## Use

```meadow
use Diff (fromLines, unifiedDiff, unifiedDiffText, diffWordParts, Myers)

def main =
  ( unifiedDiffText (unifiedDiff (fromLines "a\nb\nc\n" "a\nB\nc\n")),
    -- "@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@\n a\n-b\n+B\n c\n"
    diffWordParts Myers "one two" "one three"
    -- [(Equal, "one "), (Delete, "two"), (Insert, "three")]
  )
```

### Sequences

`captureDiffSlices alg old new` diffs two arrays of any type with equality and
returns a vector of `DiffOp`s:

| operation | meaning |
|---|---|
| `Equal oldIndex newIndex len` | `len` elements are the same on both sides |
| `Delete oldIndex oldLen newIndex` | elements were removed from the old side |
| `Insert oldIndex newIndex newLen` | elements were added on the new side |
| `Replace oldIndex oldLen newIndex newLen` | old elements were replaced by new ones |

`alg` is `Myers`, `Patience` or `Lcs`. `captureDiff alg old oa ob new na nb`
diffs just the ranges `oa..ob` and `na..nb`. `groupDiffOps ops n` splits the
operations into hunks with `n` elements of context. `getDiffRatio ops oldLen
newLen` says how alike the two sides are, from 0 to 1.

For each operation:

- `opTag`, `oldRange` and `newRange` describe it;
- `changesOf op old new` lists its elements one by one, as `Change` records
  with a `tag`, `oldIndex`, `newIndex` and `value`;
- `slicesOf op old new` gives them as runs.

### Text

A `TextDiff` is two texts cut into tokens, together with the operations
between them.

- `fromLines`, `fromWords`, `fromChars`, `fromUnicodeWords` and
  `fromGraphemes` diff two strings with the default settings.
- `diffLines config old new` and its siblings take a `TextDiffConfig`: start
  from `textDiffConfig` and set `algorithm` or `newlineTerminated`.
- `fromSlices` diffs two arrays of strings as they are.

On a `TextDiff`, `ratio`, `iterAllChanges`, `iterChanges d op` and
`groupedOps d n` work as above.

`unifiedDiff d` prints a text diff as a unified diff. It is a record whose
`contextRadius` (3), `missingNewlineHint` (`True`) and `header`
(`Just ("a/file", "b/file")`) can be changed, and `unifiedDiffText` renders it.
`unifiedDiffOf alg old new n header` does all of that in one call.

`iterInlineChanges d op` gives the lines of an operation with the changed
words marked:

- each `InlineChange` holds `values`, a vector of `(emphasized, text)`;
- `inlineChangeText` renders one the way the crate displays it, wrapping each
  changed word in `-…-` or `+…+`;
- `iterInlineChangesByWords` splits on whitespace instead of Unicode word
  bounds, as the crate does when built without `unicode`.

`diffCharParts`, `diffWordParts`, `diffUnicodeWordParts`, `diffGraphemeParts`
and `diffLineParts` return a diff as tagged runs of text. `diffSliceParts` does
the same for arrays.

`getCloseMatches word possibilities n cutoff` returns up to `n` of the
possibilities that look most like `word` and score at least `cutoff`, best
first.

## How it's made

The files in `src/` are hand translations of the crate's source:

- `Algorithms.mw`: the algorithms, and the compaction and replace hooks that
  run on their output;
- `Text.mw`: the tokenizers and close matches;
- `Unified.mw`: unified diffs;
- `Inline.mw`: inline changes.

The crate's quirks are kept, so that the port gives the same results. One
example: its LCS reports an unchanged range as starting at 0.

**`src/Cases.mw`** and **`src/CasesPlain.mw`** are generated test data:

- 1,500 sequence diffs over whole and partial ranges, with their groups;
- 906 text diffs, each with its:
  - operations and ratio;
  - changes and groups;
  - unified diff;
  - inline changes;
- 600 close-match searches;
- 700 `utils` diffs;
- the inline changes of 518 text diffs, from a build of the crate without
  `unicode`.

Every expected result comes from calling the crate. Run `scripts/generate.sh`
to regenerate; it needs a Rust toolchain.
